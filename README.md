# Dotfiles

![](/rice.png)

##### This is my personal collection of dotfiles for my Dell XPS 15 9570 running Bedrock Linux.

I've been searching for a distro for what seems like forever now, but I finally feel like I've found a setup that perfectly fits both my needs _and_ my preferences. Before I turned this into a Bedrock system, it was running Void linux (musl), which, while I personally loved, it was challenging or outright impossible to run certain software that I either needed for university, or wanted personally. This repository contains both my dotfiles, and my opinions on Bedrock Linux.  Mainly, why I believe it is a great fit for myself, and possibly for others who have a hard time completely agreeing with the philosophies and standards of an individual distribution of Linux/Unix.
